# Historical account of the group project

## Week #1 – 2/2/17

-	Group introduced themselves to each other – assessed strengths and weaknesses
-	Photos were taken of each team member
-	A platform for communicating as a group (Facebook) was established to maintain communication between the group.
-	We set up a blog system for each member in order to monitor each member progress through the development of the project
-	We assigned some members the role of reading the SEQA documents, and the other members to start planning a rough architecture proposal, and start building a basic prototype of the game

## Week #2 – 9/2/17

-	We started writing a test document, in preparation for testing after the project. This would later help us with the development of the project, as well as helping us find issues that we may not have discovered during normal development
-	We also set up our initial GitHub repository, as we did not yet have an SVN repo, and all of the team preferred GIT to SVN.
-	A formal UI Document was also started on. We discussed how we delegate different parts of the program to different people. We decided to split people into GUI and System Architecture teams, so that those who were more comfortable with Graphics and JavaFX, while those more comfortable with Data structures and program flow could work on the backend. We chose how we could make both sides of the program work with each other, using an event driven system.
-	More QA notes were produced
-  The SA team produced a detailed spec on each area that was being worked on, including the storage of objects within the game, and how different objects interact with each other.

## Week #3 – 16/2/17

-	This week we assigned roles for each person in the team – we wanted roles to be well defined, but also for people to also experience a wide range of roles within the team. As a result, we had flexibility in the roles, allowing people to use their particular skills to the best effect – some people who were more comfortable doing documentation also got to experiments with graphics and Junit testing. 
-	The test team continued with the test document, with users collaborating with one another in order to split workload.
-	The GUI Team started a use case document so that we knew as a group what we needed as a GUI, and the requirements that that GUI most have.
-	They had a presentation outlining the use case document, in order to represent the use case in a visual manner to the rest of the team
-	The SA created a basic project for the game, and started creating basic classes and methods, whilst planning out how to do the more complex methods.
-	We had a meeting later that week to discuss what has been achieved so far, and what areas needed more work.
-	We also created a way of managing each persons time within the group, so that the group leader can effectively manage each individual members time accurately, and guide people who may be doing too much/less work per week

## Week #4 – 23/2/17

-	The tests were restricted and standardised, so that all the tests could fit into one document.
-	The UI Document was finalised, and we agreed to have our review meeting for the Monday after
-	The SA Team developed the flow of the program even more, implementing states for the players, so that the game knew what it was doing at which stage of the program 
-	The GUI Team developed another prototype of the GUI, but this time with the game implementing collision detection, and better movement, following the spec even more
-	The Github was organised according to the QA document, with all the minutes and supporting documents, as well as the pre existing source code uploaded correctly and In the correct location.

## Week #5 – 02/03/17

-	The design document was started on
-	The SA team presented how the game flows through the game logic, and how the classes within the game interact with each other
-	A GUI team presented a demonstration of the GUI working with some of the game logic
-	JUnits tests were started on, and an automated tested system was implemented, using a Continuous Integration system. This also checks that all code that are done compiles, and notifies the commiter if any code that is pushed does not compile
-	Some people were tasked to implement methods that had been planned out but not yet implemented.
-	GUI Movement was completed
-	The SA Team continued with design until all of the functionality was planned
  
## Week #6 – 9/3/17

-	UI Document was improved
-	Tests document was improved
-	Powerpoint was improved
-	More JUnits were done
-	TODO’s within the code were done
  
## Week #7 – 16/03/17

-	UI Document was improved
-	Tests document was improved
-	Powerpoint was improved
-	More JUnits were done
-	More Design document work was done before having a review meeting mid week
-	The programming team worked on ports, movement and move highlighting, islands, crew cards and some of the GUI dialogue boxes to display information

## Week #8 – 23/03/17

-   More JUnits were done, the people who didn’t know how to do JUnits learnt how to
-	A big list of JUnits to do was born, and assigned to EVERYONE
-	The programming team fixed bugs in movement, and completed crew cards
 
## Week #9 – 30/03/17

-	Design document completed and with all relevant parts attached
-	Sequence diagram completed
-  Component diagram completed
- 	Object diagram completed
-	More JUnits were done
-	Graphics improved
-	The GUI Team did the Treasure Island GUI
-	Bugs were fixed
-	Trading was started
 
## Week #10 – 06/04/17

-  More Junit tests
-  Arranged to have conference meetings during the holidays
-  Trading implemented
-  Main menu completed
-  JavaDoc added

## Implementation week

-  The testing team completed all of the Junit tests, as well as testing the program as it was being completed – Issues were made by the testing team, and assigned to the appropriate member who was working on that area of the program. They also tested each new feature as It was completed. 
-  JavaDoc was completed, in order to increase the maintainability of the code
-  Code was checked to QA Standards
-  The GUI Team created new images for the game, including a new 3D gameboard and 3D Ships. They also implamented a new main menu and help menu.
-  The Chance cards were implemented by the SA team. 
-  Both the SA and GUI Team fixed bugs that were assigned by the testing team
-  GUI’s were added to give additional information on islands, ports and players.
